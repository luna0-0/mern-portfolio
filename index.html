          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am Luna Dahal, a frontend development enthusiast who enjoys
            transforming ideas into clean, functional, and visually appealing
            web interfaces. I have a strong interest in how websites are
            structured, styled, and presented to users, and I find satisfaction
            in building layouts that are both responsive and easy to use. I am
            currently learning the MERN stack and gradually expanding my
            understanding of modern web development practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            My journey into web development started with learning HTML, where I
            built a solid foundation in semantic structure and accessibility. As
            I progressed, I developed a growing interest in CSS and how it
            controls layout, spacing, responsiveness, and overall user
            experience. I enjoy experimenting with different layouts and
            improving designs step by step to make them cleaner and more
            effective.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in B.Sc. CSIT at
            Padmakanya Multiple Campus under Tribhuvan University. Through my
            academic studies, I am gaining fundamental knowledge in computer
            science concepts, programming, and software development. This
            academic background supports my practical learning and helps me
            understand the theoretical side of how applications and systems
            work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alongside my studies, I actively practice web development by
            building small projects and personal layouts that help reinforce
            what I learn. I believe that consistent practice and hands-on
            experimentation are essential for growth, and I regularly revisit my
            previous work to improve structure, styling, and responsiveness as
            my skills develop.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I am focusing on strengthening my CSS skills,
            particularly in Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design principles. I
            enjoy learning how layouts adapt across different screen sizes and
            devices, and I aim to create designs that feel natural on mobile,
            tablet, and desktop screens. Improving visual hierarchy and
            readability is something I actively work on.
          </p>

          <p>
            My long-term goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer
            capable of building complete web applications from frontend
            interfaces to backend logic. I aspire to contribute to clean,
            efficient, and user-focused web applications that solve real-world
            problems and provide meaningful user experiences. I am motivated to
            keep learning, improving, and growing as a developer through
            continuous practice and real projects.
