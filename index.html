      <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Luna Dahal, a frontend development enthusiast who enjoys
          transforming ideas into clean, functional, and visually appealing web
          interfaces. I have a strong interest in how websites are structured,
          styled, and presented to users, and I find satisfaction in building
          layouts that are both responsive and easy to use. I am currently
          learning the MERN stack and gradually expanding my understanding of
          modern web development practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey into web development started with learning HTML, where I
          built a solid foundation in semantic structure and accessibility. As I
          progressed, I developed a growing interest in CSS and how it controls
          layout, spacing, responsiveness, and overall user experience. I enjoy
          experimenting with different layouts and improving designs step by
          step to make them cleaner and more effective.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in B.Sc. CSIT at
          Padmakanya Multiple Campus under Tribhuvan University. Through my
          academic studies, I am gaining fundamental knowledge in computer
          science concepts, programming, and software development. This academic
          background supports my practical learning and helps me understand the
          theoretical side of how applications and systems work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alongside my studies, I actively practice web development by building
          small projects and personal layouts that help reinforce what I learn.
          I believe that consistent practice and hands-on experimentation are
          essential for growth, and I regularly revisit my previous work to
          improve structure, styling, and responsiveness as my skills develop.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am focusing on strengthening my CSS skills, particularly
          in Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design principles. I enjoy learning
          how layouts adapt across different screen sizes and devices, and I aim
          to create designs that feel natural on mobile, tablet, and desktop
          screens. Improving visual hierarchy and readability is something I
          actively work on.
        </p>

        <p>
          My long-term goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer capable
          of building complete web applications from frontend interfaces to
          backend logic. I aspire to contribute to clean, efficient, and
          user-focused web applications that solve real-world problems and
          provide meaningful user experiences. I am motivated to keep learning,
          improving, and growing as a developer through continuous practice and
          real projects.
